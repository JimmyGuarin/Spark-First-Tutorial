Define a DAG (directed acyclic graph).
A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles.

## Transformations:
Create children RDDs from parents RDDs

In Apache Spark, a transformation is an operation that creates a new RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) or DataFrame from an existing one. Transformations are lazy, meaning they define a computation that Spark will execute only when an action is called. Transformations form the core of Spark's processing model, allowing you to specify the logical data flow without executing it immediately.

#### Key Characteristics of Transformations:

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Transformations are not executed immediately. Instead, they build up a logical execution plan (a Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG) that Spark executes when an action is invoked.
2. **Immutability**: Transformations do not modify the original RDD or DataFrame. Instead, they return a new RDD or DataFrame.
3. **Two Types of Transformations**:
   - **Narrow Transformations**: Each partition of the parent RDD is used by at most one partition of the child RDD. Examples include `map`, `filter`, and `flatMap`. These transformations can be pipelined within a single stage.
   - **Wide Transformations**: Multiple child partitions may depend on each partition of the parent RDD. Examples include `reduceByKey`, `groupByKey`, and `join`. These transformations usually trigger a shuffle, creating stage boundaries.

#### Common Transformations:

#### On RDDs:
- **`map(func)`**: Returns a new RDD by applying a function to each element of the parent RDD.
  ```scala
  val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3, 4))
  val result = rdd.map(x => x * 2)
  ```

- **`filter(func)`**: Returns a new RDD containing only the elements that satisfy a predicate function.
  ```scala
  val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3, 4))
  val result = rdd.filter(x => x % 2 == 0)
  ```

- **`flatMap(func)`**: Similar to `map`, but each input item can be mapped to zero or more output items (flattening the result).
  ```scala
  val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq("hello world", "apache spark"))
  val result = rdd.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))
  ```

- **`distinct()`**: Returns a new RDD with distinct elements.
  ```scala
  val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4))
  val result = rdd.distinct()
  ```

- **`union(otherRDD)`**: Returns a new RDD containing elements from both RDDs.
  ```scala
  val rdd1 = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3))
  val rdd2 = sc.parallelize(Seq(3, 4, 5))
  val result = rdd1.union(rdd2)
  ```

- **`intersection(otherRDD)`**: Returns a new RDD containing only elements present in both RDDs.
  ```scala
  val rdd1 = sc.parallelize(Seq(1, 2, 3))
  val rdd2 = sc.parallelize(Seq(3, 4, 5))
  val result = rdd1.intersection(rdd2)
  ```

- **`groupByKey()`**: Groups the values for each key in the RDD into a single sequence. Useful for aggregations.
  ```scala
  val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 2)))
  val result = rdd.groupByKey()
  ```

- **`reduceByKey(func)`**: Combines values with the same key using a specified associative function and returns a new RDD.
  ```scala
  val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("a", 2)))
  val result = rdd.reduceByKey(_ + _)
  ```

#### On DataFrames/Datasets:
- **`select(cols: Column*)`**: Projects a set of expressions and returns a new DataFrame.
  ```scala
  val df = spark.read.json("path/to/json")
  val result = df.select("name", "age")
  ```

- **`filter(condition: Column)`**: Filters rows using a condition.
  ```scala
  val df = spark.read.json("path/to/json")
  val result = df.filter($"age" > 21)
  ```

- **`groupBy(cols: Column*)`**: Groups the DataFrame using the specified columns.
  ```scala
  val df = spark.read.json("path/to/json")
  val result = df.groupBy("age").count()
  ```

- **`join(right: Dataset[_], usingColumn: String)`**: Joins with another DataFrame using the specified column.
  ```scala
  val df1 = spark.read.json("path/to/json1")
  val df2 = spark.read.json("path/to/json2")
  val result = df1.join(df2, "id")
  ```

### Example of Lazy Evaluation:

```scala
val rdd = sc.textFile("hdfs://path/to/file")
val words = rdd.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))
val filteredWords = words.filter(word => word.length > 3)
val wordPairs = filteredWords.map(word => (word, 1))
val wordCounts = wordPairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)
wordCounts.collect()  // Action triggers the execution
```

In this example, the transformations (`flatMap`, `filter`, `map`, `reduceByKey`) define a series of operations. These operations are not executed until the `collect()` action is called, triggering the actual computation.

Transformations allow you to define complex data processing workflows in a declarative manner, building up an execution plan that Spark can optimize and execute efficiently.

## Actions:
Convert a DAG into an execution plan

An action is an operation that triggers the execution of the previously defined transformations and returns a result to the driver program or writes data to an external storage system. Unlike transformations, which are lazy and only define a computation graph, actions actually execute the computation.

Here are some common actions in Spark:

1. **`collect()`**: Retrieves the entire RDD or DataFrame to the driver program as an array.
2. **`count()`**: Returns the number of elements in the RDD or rows in the DataFrame.
3. **`take(n)`**: Returns the first `n` elements of the RDD or DataFrame.
4. **`reduce(func)`**: Aggregates the elements of the RDD or DataFrame using the provided function.
5. **`saveAsTextFile(path)`**: Saves the RDD or DataFrame as a text file at the specified path.
6. **`saveAsSequenceFile(path)`**: Saves the RDD or DataFrame as a Hadoop SequenceFile at the specified path.
7. **`saveAsObjectFile(path)`**: Saves the RDD as a sequence of serialized Java objects at the specified path.
8. **`foreach(func)`**: Applies the provided function to each element of the RDD or DataFrame.
9. **`show(n)`**: Displays the first `n` rows of the DataFrame in a tabular format.

Actions are essential for producing outputs or writing data, and they are the points at which the Spark engine actually performs the computations defined by the transformations.

## Jobs

In Apache Spark, a job is a high-level unit of work that is created in response to an action being called on an RDD or DataFrame. When an action is invoked (such as `collect()`, `count()`, `saveAsTextFile()`, etc.), Spark creates a job to execute the series of transformations needed to produce the final result.

Here are the key points about jobs in Spark:

1. **Triggering Actions**: A job is triggered by an action. Each action in Spark corresponds to a single job. For example, if you call `count()` on an RDD, Spark creates a job to count the elements.

2. **Job Execution Plan**: When a job is created, Spark constructs an execution plan, which consists of multiple stages. Each stage contains a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel.

3. **Stages**: A job is divided into stages based on shuffle boundaries. A shuffle is required when a transformation needs to redistribute data across partitions (e.g., `reduceByKey`). Each stage consists of tasks that can be executed without shuffling the data.

4. **Tasks**: Within each stage, the work is further divided into tasks. Each task operates on a partition of the data. Tasks within the same stage can be executed in parallel across the cluster.

5. **Dependency Graph**: Spark uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent the sequence of transformations and dependencies. The DAG is used to determine how to break the job into stages and tasks.

6. **Job Monitoring**: The Spark UI provides detailed information about jobs, including their status, stages, and tasks. You can use the Spark UI to monitor the progress and performance of each job.

### Example

Consider the following Spark job:
```scala
val rdd = sc.textFile("hdfs://path/to/file")
  .map(line => line.split(","))
  .filter(arr => arr.length > 2)
  .map(arr => (arr(0), arr(1).toInt))
val result = rdd.reduceByKey(_ + _)
result.collect()
```

Here's what happens step-by-step:
1. **Transformations**: The transformations (`map`, `filter`, `map`, `reduceByKey`) are defined but not executed immediately.
2. **Action**: The `collect()` action triggers the execution of the job.
3. **Job Creation**: Spark creates a job for the `collect()` action.
4. **Stages and Tasks**: The job is divided into stages based on shuffle boundaries. In this case, `reduceByKey` causes a shuffle, so there will be at least two stages. Each stage is further divided into tasks that operate on data partitions.
5. **Execution**: Spark executes the tasks in each stage, using the cluster's resources to run tasks in parallel.
6. **Result**: The result of the job is collected and returned to the driver program.

### Monitoring Jobs

The Spark UI allows you to monitor jobs in real time. You can see:
- **Active Jobs**: Jobs currently running.
- **Completed Jobs**: Jobs that have finished execution.
- **Failed Jobs**: Jobs that encountered errors.

For each job, you can drill down to view the stages and tasks, helping you understand the execution flow and identify performance bottlenecks or errors.

In summary, a job in Spark is a top-level unit of computation created in response to an action. It consists of multiple stages and tasks, and its execution can be monitored using the Spark UI.

**Tasks**

A task is the smallest unit of work that represents a single operation to be applied to a partition of the data. Tasks are executed by the Spark workers and are the fundamental units of parallel execution in Spark.

Here are the key points about tasks in Spark:

1. **Execution of Stages**: Each stage in a Spark job consists of multiple tasks. All tasks in a stage execute the same computation but on different partitions of the data.

2. **Parallelism**: Tasks enable parallelism in Spark. By dividing the data into partitions and assigning tasks to process each partition, Spark can leverage multiple cores or machines to perform computations concurrently.

3. **Task Types**: There are different types of tasks in Spark, depending on the operation being performed. For example, there are tasks for map operations, reduce operations, shuffle operations, etc.

4. **Task Scheduling**: Spark's scheduler assigns tasks to worker nodes based on resource availability and data locality. Data locality means that tasks are preferably assigned to nodes that hold the data partition they need to process, minimizing data transfer.

5. **Task Execution**: A task runs a sequence of transformations on a partition of the data. For example, if a stage includes a `map` transformation, each task in that stage will apply the `map` function to a specific partition of the RDD or DataFrame.

6. **Fault Tolerance**: Spark's resilient distributed dataset (RDD) model ensures fault tolerance by re-executing failed tasks. If a task fails, Spark can recompute it by applying the original transformations to the corresponding partition.

7. **Task Metrics**: Spark collects various metrics for each task, such as execution time, shuffle read/write metrics, and input/output data sizes. These metrics can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of Spark jobs.

8. **Task Execution Environment**: Each task runs in its own JVM (Java Virtual Machine) process on the worker node, providing isolation and robustness. Tasks can also benefit from the caching and data serialization mechanisms provided by Spark to optimize performance.

In summary, a task in Spark is a unit of work that processes a partition of the data, enabling parallel execution of computations across the cluster. Tasks are essential for achieving the distributed and fault-tolerant nature of Spark.


## Stage

A stage is a set of tasks that are executed together as part of a larger computation. Each stage in Spark represents a unit of work that can be performed in parallel. Stages are created during the execution of a Spark job and are the result of dividing the job's computation graph into smaller, more manageable parts.

Here are some key points about stages in Spark:

1. **Division by Shuffles**: Stages are divided based on the presence of wide dependencies, such as shuffles. A shuffle occurs when data needs to be redistributed across the cluster, typically when performing operations like `reduceByKey` or `groupByKey`.

2. **Narrow vs. Wide Dependencies**:
    - **Narrow Dependencies**: Each parent partition is used by at most one child partition (e.g., `map`, `filter`). Operations with narrow dependencies can be pipelined together into a single stage.
    - **Wide Dependencies**: Each parent partition can be used by multiple child partitions (e.g., `reduceByKey`, `join`). These operations typically require a shuffle and create a boundary between stages.

3. **Task Execution**: Within a stage, multiple tasks are executed in parallel, where each task processes a partition of the data. All tasks in a stage perform the same operation on different slices of the data.

4. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**: Spark constructs a DAG of stages for each job. The DAG represents the logical flow of computations and dependencies between RDDs (or DataFrames).

5. **Stage Boundaries**: The boundaries of stages are determined by shuffle operations. Spark plans the execution such that all tasks within a stage can be executed without requiring data to be redistributed across nodes.

6. **Execution Plan**: When an action is called, Spark computes an execution plan that includes multiple stages. The plan ensures efficient execution by minimizing data shuffling and maximizing parallelism.

For example, in a job with a sequence of transformations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduceByKey`, Spark might create two stages:
- The first stage would include the `map` and `filter` transformations (since they involve narrow dependencies).
- The second stage would be created for the `reduceByKey` transformation (since it involves a wide dependency and requires a shuffle).

Understanding stages is crucial for optimizing Spark jobs, as it helps identify potential bottlenecks and areas where performance can be improved by reducing shuffles or rethinking the computation flow.

## Pipelining

In Apache Spark, pipelining refers to the technique of combining multiple transformations into a single stage, allowing them to be executed in a sequence without requiring intermediate data to be shuffled or written to disk. This is possible when the transformations have narrow dependencies, meaning that each parent partition is used by at most one child partition.

Here are the key points about pipelining in Spark:

1. **Narrow Dependencies**: Pipelining is applicable to transformations with narrow dependencies, such as `map`, `filter`, and `flatMap`. These operations can be applied one after another on each partition without needing to redistribute the data across the cluster.

2. **Optimization**: By pipelining transformations, Spark reduces the overhead associated with intermediate data storage and shuffle operations. This leads to improved performance and resource utilization.

3. **Execution Plan**: When Spark creates the execution plan for a job, it identifies transformations that can be pipelined together into a single stage. The resulting plan minimizes the number of stages and shuffle operations, optimizing the overall job execution.

4. **Task Execution**: Within a stage, tasks execute the pipelined transformations sequentially on each partition. For example, if a stage includes `map` followed by `filter`, each task will apply the `map` function to its partition and then immediately apply the `filter` function to the result.

5. **Example**: Consider the following Spark job:
   ```scala
   val rdd = sc.textFile("hdfs://path/to/file")
     .map(line => line.split(","))
     .filter(arr => arr.length > 2)
     .map(arr => (arr(0), arr(1).toInt))
   rdd.collect()
   ```
   In this example, the `map`, `filter`, and subsequent `map` transformations can be pipelined together into a single stage. Each task will read a partition of the input file, apply the `map`, `filter`, and `map` transformations in sequence, and then proceed to the next partition.

6. **Stage Boundaries**: While pipelining is efficient for narrow dependencies, wide dependencies (e.g., `reduceByKey`, `groupByKey`) require shuffle operations, which create stage boundaries. Stages with wide dependencies cannot be pipelined and must wait for the shuffle to complete before proceeding.

7. **Performance**: Pipelining transformations reduces the latency and resource consumption associated with intermediate data handling. It allows Spark to take full advantage of its in-memory processing capabilities and speeds up job execution.

In summary, pipelining in Spark is the process of combining multiple transformations with narrow dependencies into a single stage, enabling efficient execution without intermediate shuffles. This optimization improves performance and resource utilization in Spark jobs.
